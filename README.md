DNN for Single Cell Age Prediction

This is a DNN for predicting the age of an individual based on single cell RNA-seq data. Roughly, we have multiple cells derived from each donor, which we then use to train the network to predict the age of the individual, given the transcriptome of a single cell. At this point we cannot publically share any further information on the data used or the quantitative results, however you are welcome for asking questions about the algorithm. The (qualitative) predictive power of the model is shown in the image below:
